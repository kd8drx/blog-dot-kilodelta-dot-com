If hobbies were cats, I'd be a crazy cat lady. Alas, I merely have [two cats](http://instagram.com/themooncats), a [dog](https://www.instagram.com/gizmogadgetdog), and a [wife](https://www.threads.net/@meggiesetgo).

I'm currently based in Hollywood, CA; but before that spent several years in San Francisco and Seattle. The Pacific Northwest, in particular, [will always own a chunk of my soul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc7jTzgrWBI).

During the day, I'm an IT Engineer and MacAdmin with well over a decade of professional experience - and even more _if_ you consider getting called out of class in 5th grade to fix the school computer lab!

I've given talks at [MacDevOpsYVR 2020](https://youtu.be/oRPiUR2XQ6w) and [Elastic's 2020 Global All Hands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRPiUR2XQ6w). You can [find my current resum√© here](http://kiley.me/kiley-davidson-resume.pdf).

Besides my work in tech, I'm a [ham radio operator](http://qrz.com/db/KD8DRX) and an unrepentant maker. I was a board member for the [San Francisco Radio Club](https://www.sfarc.org) for two years (2020 and 2021), and helped co-found the San Francisco Wireless Emergency Mesh (now Bay Area Mesh), which provides high-speed data connectivity during emergencies in the San Francisco area.
